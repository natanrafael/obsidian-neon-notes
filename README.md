# obsidian-neon-notes

Just a scss/css project, called "NeonNotes", made to stylize my obsidian.md

The idea of this theme is to delivery the most of that 'cyberpunk interface' as possible, and as a wise man once said...

### Initially, the project will be focused on the dark-theme interface.

Have a quick look on my snippets made specially to this theme: [NeonNotes Snippets](https://github.com/natanrafael/obsidian-neon-notes-snippets)
